Convert hex to base64

The string:
```
49276d206b696c6c696e6720796f757220627261696e206c696b65206120706f69736f6e6f7573206d757368726f6f6d
```

Should produce:
```
SSdtIGtpbGxpbmcgeW91ciBicmFpbiBsaWtlIGEgcG9pc29ub3VzIG11c2hyb29t
```

Cryptopals Rule:
```
Always operate on raw bytes, never on encoded strings. Only use hex and base64 for pretty-printing.
```

Fixed XOR

Write a function that takes two equal-length buffers and produces their XOR combination.

If your function works properly, then when you feed it the string:
```
1c0111001f010100061a024b53535009181c

```

... after hex decoding, and when XOR'd against:
```
686974207468652062756c6c277320657965
```

... should produce:
```
746865206b696420646f6e277420706c6179
```

Single-byte XOR cipher

The hex encoded string:
```
1b37373331363f78151b7f2b783431333d78397828372d363c78373e783a393b3736
```

... has been XOR'd against a single character. Find the key, decrypt the message.

You can do this by hand. But don't: write code to do it for you.

How? Devise some method for "scoring" a piece of English plaintext. Character frequency is a good metric. Evaluate each output and choose the one with the best score.

Detect single-character XOR

One of the 60-character strings in this file has been encrypted by single-character XOR.

Find it.

Implement repeating-key XOR

Here is the opening stanza of an important work of the English language:
```
Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
```

Encrypt it, under the key "ICE", using repeating-key XOR.

In repeating-key XOR, you'll sequentially apply each byte of the key; the first byte of plaintext will be XOR'd against I, the next C, the next E, then I again for the 4th byte, and so on.

It should come out to:
```
0b3637272a2b2e63622c2e69692a23693a2a3c6324202d623d63343c2a26226324272765272a282b2f20430a652e2c652a3124333a653e2b2027630c692b20283165286326302e27282f
```

Encrypt a bunch of stuff using your repeating-key XOR function. Encrypt your mail. Encrypt your password file. Your .sig file. Get a feel for it. I promise, we aren't wasting your time with this.
